        <h1>Understanding Factorial and Its Generation</h1>
        <p>Factorials are an essential concept in mathematics, used across a variety of fields like combinatorics, probability, and calculus. In this blog, we'll explain what factorials are, why they are significant, and how to generate them using a simple loop in JavaScript.</p>
        <h2>What is factorial</h2>
        <p>A factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
            </p>
            <h2>Significance of factorial</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Probability and Statistics:</strong>Factorials are key in calculating probabilities, particularly in problems involving permutations and combinations.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Science and Algorithms:</strong> In computer science, factorials are used in various algorithms, such as those involving recursion and dynamic programming.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h2>Generating Factorial Using a simple Loop in JavaScript</h2>
    <pre><code>
    function factorial(n) {
        let fact = 1;  
        
        // Loop through numbers from 1 to n and multiply them
        for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            fact *= i;  
        }
        
        return fact;  // Return the computed factorial
    }
    
    let n=5; //generate Factorial
    console.log(`The factorial of ${n} is ${(factorial(n))}`);
    
    </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Output:</h3>
    <pre><code>The factorial of 5 is 120</code></pre>
    
    <p>
        <ol>
          <h3>Explaination</h3>
           <li>We start with fact = 1, because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the result.</li>
           <li>The for loop runs from 1 to n, and for each iteration, it multiplies the current value of result by i.</li>
           <li>After the loop finishes, the factorial value is returned.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
